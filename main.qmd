# Ideas Updates

1.  What constitutes as severe accident?

2.  Adjusted Model for Truck Parking Analysis

3.  Data Cleaning Progress

## What constitutes as severe accident?

zscore \> 2 is my definition of severe

# Adjusted Model for Truck Parking Analysis

## Adjusted Model for Truck Parking Analysis

-   Fix limited observations

-   ways to deal with it?

## Adjusted Model for Truck Parking Analysis

look at $\Delta_{2006}$ and change in $\Delta_{2016}$ vs look at $\Delta_{2006-206}$

## Adjusted Model for Truck Parking Analysis

$$
\Delta\text{Num\_Truck\_Stop}_{t=2006-2016} = \sum_{i=2}^{0} \beta_{t-i} \text{TPA}_{t-i}\cdot \text{Severity} \\
+ \gamma X_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-   \$ \text{TPA}\_{t-i} \$: A lagged dummy variable indicating a severe truck parking accident.
-   Severity is our measure of severity of the accident ('VEHICLES_IN_ACCIDENT' or 'INJURIES' or Fatalities)

# Data Cleaning

## Data Cleaning Tips?

need to join to 1 column how?
